        "\n",
        "- Each agent has a clear role, goal and a backstroy(description)\n",
        "- For each agent, you can specify a set of tools (crewAI tools, LangChain tools, or your own tools)\n",
        "- For each agent, you specify a task. It contains a description (instructions) and the expected ouputs. The task can also contains other parameters such as tools (overriding Agent tools), various outpout formats...\n",
        "- Then, you create the Crew, the manager, on which you specify your agents and their tasks (the order matter) and the process the agents need to follow to execute the tasks and provide the final answer.\n",
        "- The process involves how the agents collaborate with each other.\n",
        "- The one used is the Hierarchical process, in which the manager decices to which co-worker agent the next task will be delegated, and also handle the memory transition between the different agents. In this process, agents not only answer to the task but also refine the results of the other agents and ask for further improvements. Sequential process also exists.\n",
        "- Regardless of the choosen process, agents can also delegate tasks among themselves."

        "- Trading Platform: Ensure access to a reliable trading platform that can handle high- frequency trading and is capable of setting advanced order types.  \n",
        "- Market Data Subscription: Subscribe to real-time market data for AAPL and relevant economic indicators to stay updated.\n",
        "- Alerts Setup: Configure alerts for moving average crossovers (50-day crossing above 200-day for buys, and 50-day crossing below 200-day for sells).  \n",
        "  \n",
        "2. Execution Strategy\n",
        "- Buy Signal: Execute a buy order when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. This indicates a bullish trend likely spurred by positive market reception to Apple’s AI advancements.  \n",
        "– Timing: Aim to execute during early trading hours when liquidity is higher, reducing market impact.  \n",
        "– Order Type: Use limit orders set slightly above the current market price to avoid slippage.\n",
        "- Sell Signal: Execute a sell order when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. This could reflect market corrections or negative reactions to competitive pressures from Microsoft.  \n",
        "– Timing: Execute during mid-day trading to capitalize on typically higher trading vol- umes, which can help mask the trade.  \n",
        "– Order Type: Use limit orders set slightly below the current market price for better control over the execution price.    \n",
        "3. Risk Management\n",
        "- Stop-Loss Orders: Set stop-loss orders at 5-10% below the purchase price for all buys to mitigate potential losses from sudden market downturns.  \n",
        "- Position Sizing: Limit the size of any single trade to no more than 10% of the total trading portfolio to manage exposure and risk.\n",
        "4. Monitoring and Adjustments.\n",
        "- Regular Strategy Reviews: Conduct bi-weekly reviews of the trading strategy’s perfor- mance, particularly how the AI developments are influencing market dynamics.  \n",
        "- Adjustments: Be prepared to adjust the strategy parameters (e.g., moving average periods, stop-loss levels) based on ongoing market conditions and performance analysis.  \n",
        "5. Market Considerations.\n",
        "- AI Developments Impact: Closely monitor news and developments regarding Apple’s and Microsoft’s AI technologies. Positive news about Apple’s AI features could be used as an opportunity to increase positions, while advancements from Microsoft should prompt a review of potential risks.\n",
        "- Competitive Landscape: Keep an eye on how the competitive dynamics between Apple and Microsoft evolve, as these will influence investor sentiment and market movements.  \n",
